# Calculator-JavaScript

The calculator that I have developed in JavaScript is a versatile and functional tool that allows you to perform mathematical operations easily and quickly. Its intuitive and elegant design makes it a perfect choice for anyone who needs to perform calculations online.

With this calculator, you will be able to perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In addition, it has advanced functions such as exponentiation, square root and percentage, which makes it a useful tool for both everyday tasks and more complex calculations.

The calculator interface is easy to use and adapts to different devices, which means that you can use it comfortably from your computer, tablet or mobile phone. The buttons and display screen are designed clearly and legibly, making it easy to enter and view numbers and operations.

A standout feature of this calculator is its ability to perform calculations in real time as you enter numbers and operations. This allows you to make quick and precise adjustments before getting the final result. In addition, the calculator shows the history of calculations made, which allows you to review and correct any previous operations.

This calculator has been developed using JavaScript, a programming language widely used in web development. The JavaScript implementation allows for a smooth and dynamic user experience, without the need to refresh the page.
